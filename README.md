EXPERIMENT 1
1. run generate_data.m - This creates all the data from reprojecting images
2. run generate_training_rays.m - This takes the valid training rays and saves them as xxx_ready.mat
3. run generate_test_img.m - This generates the test image for visualization

4. Load all xxx_ready.mat files into main.py and start training
5. Run test_data.py to save a .npy file that can be visualized
